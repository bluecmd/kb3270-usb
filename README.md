# KB3270 USB Conversion

This repository contains firmware for an Arduino based USB conversion of the 3270 mainframe keyboard KB3270 Plus.
The hardware that is assumed to be used is an Adafruit ItsyBitsy 32u4 - 5V 16MHz.

The keyboard is put into native mode and all keys have been mapped to USB HID equivalents. This means you will be able to use all keys as long as your operating system supports these extra HID keys. Linux is supported, other OSes are not so clear cut.
